# Synthetic Data

Fabric’s Synthetic Data allows data scientists to leverage advanced Machine Learning models to **create high-quality synthetic data** that mimics the characteristics and behavior of real data while maintaining data privacy. This technology unlocks **privacy-enhanced data sharing**, fosters data quality through **data augmentation**, and boosts the fairness and generalization ability of AI models by **increasing the diversity of training datasets** through the tailored generation of underrepresented concepts in real data.

The Synthetic Data module includes the following functionalities:

- Comprehensive support for tabular, time-series, transactional data, and relational databases;
- Optimized and automatic model selection for synthetic data generation;
- Tailored synthetic data generation, enabling anonymization, business controls and conditional sampling;
- Customizable privacy control for optimized trade-offs between fidelity, and utility, privacy;
- Flexible synthetic data quality assessment in a standard PDF format.


!!! question "Should I buy or build a synthetic data generation solution?"
    If you’re looking to fully unlock your assets for data sharing or secure development initiatives for your organization, open-source solutions will not be able to cope with your specific business needs, data flow’s complexity, and scale. Fabric’s interfaces (GUI and code) enable different profiles within an organization to leverage the benefits of synthetic data, from data stewards and quality assurance engineers all the way to data analysts and data scientists.
