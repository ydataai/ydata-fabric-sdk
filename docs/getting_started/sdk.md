# YData SDK

The YData Python SDK acts as a Python interface to the functionalities available in Fabric, providing an **ecosystem of methods that allow users to leverage the benefits of Fabric inside code environments**. YData SDK offers some of the same components for data ingestion and data quality evaluation and improvement as Fabric, currently incorporating the following modules:

- **Connectors and Data Sources**, including the RDBMs and Cloud Object Storage available in the Data Catalog;
- **Synthetic Data**, including anonymization, privacy control, and conditional sampling and supporting all data types, from tabular, time-series, transactional, and relational databases;
- **Synthetic Data Quality Report** <span style="color:grey">*Coming soon*</span>
- **Data Profiling** <span style="color:grey">*Coming soon*</span>
