# Labs

Laboratories (referred to as **Labs**) are on-demand, cloud-based data development environments with automatically provisioned hardware. Labs enable a full platform integration via the YData Python SDK, allowing users to easily access Data Sources, Synthesizers, and the workspaceâ€™s shared files. Labs further incorporate the following:

- Multiple infrastructure configurations, including GPUs;
- Integration with popular data science IDEs, including Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab, and H2O Flow;
- Support for both R and Python with preconfigured data science bundles such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

!!! question "Why should I use Labs?"
    Labs exist for Data Scientists to tackle more complex use cases through a familiar environment supercharged with infrastructure, integration with other Platform modules and access to advanced synthesis and profiling technology via a familiar SDK.
    It is the preferred environment for Data Scientists to express their domain expertise with all the required tools, technology, and computational power at their fingertips. It is thus the natural continuation of the data understanding works which started in the Data Catalog.
