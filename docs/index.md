# Welcome

Write here an intro about data-centric AI the importance of data quality for the success of AI.

[YData Fabric](https://ydata.ai/products/fabric) is a **[Data-Centric AI](https://ydata.ai/products/data_centric_ai)** workbench that **accelerates AI development
by helping data scientists achieve production-quality data**. (Explain here a bit more the concept and mention the SDK)

Fabric is an end-to-end data development solution that can be hosted on cloud environments
(e.g., Azure, AWS, and GCP, among others) or on-prem. If you are ready to start your journey into data
quality for AI join Fabric Community[link] and get started with our quickstart
tutorial[link to a short quiskstart guide].

## Why adopt YData Fabric?
[Write here the why it should be adopted]

## üìù Key features

### Data Catalog
[Fabric Data Catalog](https://ydata.ai/products/data_catalog) provides a centralized perspective on datasets within a project-basis, optimizing data management
through seamless integration with the organization's existing data architectures via scalable connectors (e.g., MySQL, Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3).
It standardizes data quality profiling, streamlining the processes of efficient data cleaning and preparation,
while also automating the identification of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to facilitate compliance with privacy regulations.

### Labs

Fabric's Labs environments provide collaborative, scalable, and secure workspaces layered on a flexible infrastructure, enabling users to
seamlessly switch between CPUs and GPUs based on their computational needs. Labs are familiar environments that empower data developers with
powerful IDEs (Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Code or H2O flow) and a seamless experience with the tools they already love combined with YData's
cutting-edge SDK for data preparation.

### Synthetic data
Synthetic data, enabled by YData Fabric, provides data developers with a user-friendly interfaces (UI and code) for
generating artificial datasets, offering a versatile solution across formats like tabular, time-series and multi-table datasets.
The generated synthetic data holds the same value of the original and aligns intricately with specific business rules, contributing
to machine learning models enhancement, mitigation of privacy concerns and more robustness for data developments.
Fabric offers synthetic data that is ease to adapt and configure, allows customization in what concerns privacy-utility trade-offs.

### Pipelines
Fabric Pipelines streamlines data preparation workflows by automating, orchestrating, and optimizing data pipelines,
providing benefits such as flexibility, scalability, monitoring, and reproducibility for efficient and reliable data processing.
The intuitive drag-and-drop interface, leveraging Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts, expedites the pipeline setup process,
providing data developers with a quick and user-friendly experience.
