# Tabular synthetic data generation

Tabular synthetic data generation is a powerful method to create high-quality artificial datasets
that mirror the statistical properties of original tabular data. A tabular dataset is usually composed by
several columns with structured data and mixed data types (dates, categorical, numerical, etc) with not time dependence
between records.
This ability of generating synthetic data from this type of datasets is essential for a wide range of
applications, from data augmentation to privacy preservation, and is particularly useful in scenarios where
obtaining or using real data is challenging.
