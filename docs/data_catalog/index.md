# Data Catalog

We need to improve the below narrative Mainly focus on:

- What is Fabric's Data Catalog
- What are the benefits for the developers
- What can be found in Fabric's Catalog - Connectors & Datasets (no need to explain them here, only links for the next sections)

The narrative of a Data-Centric platform must, as expected, start with the data. Data Sources are the primary way of ingesting and understanding data.

To ensure that large volumes of data can be processed through the entire platform, integrated direct Connectors for various types of data sources - namely relational database management systems (RDBMS), data warehouses, remote object storages and even local files - exist. These Connectors offer:

- **simplified** authentication
- **scalability** and **high-throughput**, through the combination of a distributed computing engine with an infrastructure which scales on-demand
- **security**, as the connection is direct and data is never moved from the original premises (only read into memory and discarded when no longer necessary)
