analysis or operational use.
- **Automation of data flows:** They automate the process of data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL), which is crucial for maintaining up-to-date and accurate the data that is being used for a certain project.
- **Simplification of data access:** Fabric connectors experience simplify the process of accessing and using data from specialized or complex systems, making it easier for users without deep technical expertise to leverage data
for insights.
- **Enhancement of Data Security:** Designed to manage in a secure way the credentials and access to your different storage.
