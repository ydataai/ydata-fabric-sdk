# Fabric coding environment

^^[**YData Fabric Labs**](https://ydata.ai/products/fabric)^^ are on-demand, cloud-based data development environments with automatically provisioned hardware (multiple infrastructure configurations,
including GPUs, are possible) and **full platform integration** via a Python interface (allowing access to Data Sources, Synthesizers,
and the Workspaceâ€™s shared files).

Wit Labs, you can create environment with the support to familiar IDEs like [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [**Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**
and [**H20 Flow**](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/flow.html), with support for both Python and R are included.

For Python specifically, pre-configured bundles including TensorFlow, PyTorch and/or the main popular data science libraries
are also available, jumpstarting data development. Additional libraries can be easily installed leveraging a simple *!pip install*
