# Overview

Labs exist for Data practitioners to tackle more complex use cases through a familiar environment supercharged with infrastructure, 
integration with other Fabric modules and access to advanced synthesis and profiling technology via a familiar python interface.

It is the preferred environment for Data practitioners to express their domain expertise with all the required tools, 
technology and computational power at their fingertips. It is thus the natural continuation of the data understanding works which 
started in Data Sources.

## Existing Labs

Existing Labs appear in the *Labs* pane of the web application. Besides information about its settings and status, three buttons exist:

- **Open:** Open the Labâ€™s IDE in a new browser tab
- **Pause:** Pause the Lab. When resumed, all data will be available.
- **Delete:** Lab will be deleted. Data not saved in the workspaceâ€™s shared folder (see below) will be deleted.

- ðŸ”´ Lab was shutdown due to an error. A common error is the Lab going out-of-memory. Additional details are offered in the web application.
