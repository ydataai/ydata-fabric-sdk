The solution includes a set of integrated components for data ingestion, standardized data quality evaluation and data improvement, such as synthetic data generation, allowing an iterative improvement of the datasets used in high-impact business applications.</p> <p>Synthetic data can be used as Machine Learning performance enhancer, to augment or mitigate the presence of bias in real data. Furthermore, it can be used as a Privacy Enhancing Technology, to enable data-sharing initiatives or even to fuel testing environments. </p> <p>Under the YData-SDK hood, you can find a set of algorithms and metrics based on statistics and deep learning based techniques, that will help you to accelerate your data preparation. </p>"},{"location":"#current-functionality","title":"Current functionality","text":"<p>YData SDK is currently composed by the following main modules:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Datasources</p> </li> <li> <p>Synthesizers</p> </li> <li> <p>Synthetic data quality report</p> </li> <li> <p>Profiling</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"support/help-troubleshooting/","title":"Help &amp; Troubleshooting","text":""}]}
